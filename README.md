# ale-wrapper

The purpose of this repository is to link the TPG [GEGELATI library](https://github.com/gegelati/gegelati) to the [ALE interface](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment). 

## How does this work ?
The ale-wrapper is built to hide the ALE part, so the main file which handles the training is really close to the ones we write for other Gegelati applications, see [GEGELATI-APPS](https://github.com/gegelati/gegelati-apps) for examples. There is also an example called "LearningExample" in this repository.
